            <h1>Rules of BlackJack:</h1>
            <br>
            <p>
                Welcome to the exciting world of Blackjack! This classic card game is easy to learn and offers a thrilling experience at the casino. 
                Here are the basic rules to get you started:
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                <h2>Objective:</h2>
                <br>
                The goal of Blackjack is to beat the dealer by having a hand value closer to 21 without exceeding it. 
                A hand value of 21 with your first two cards is called a "Blackjack" and is the best possible outcome.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                <h2>Card Values:</h2>
                <br>
                Number cards (2-10) are worth their face value.
                Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are each worth 10 points.
                Aces can be worth either 1 or 11 points, depending on which value benefits your hand more.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                <h2>Gameplay:</h2>
                <br><br>
                <b>1º</b>
                <br>
                <u>Dealing Cards:</u> 
                <br><br>
                Each player, including the dealer, is dealt two cards. Players' cards are usually dealt face-up, while the dealer has one card face-up 
                (known as the "upcard") and one face-down (known as the "hole card").
                <br><br>
                <b>2º</b>
                <br>
                <u>Player's Turn:</u>
                <br><br>
                You can choose to "Hit" to receive another card or "Stand" to keep your current hand.
                You can continue to hit until you decide to stand, or your hand exceeds 21, resulting in a "bust."
                <br><br>
                <b>3º</b>
                <br>
                <u>Dealer's Turn:</u>
                <br><br>
                Once all players have completed their turn, the dealer reveals the hole card.
                The dealer must hit until their hand reaches at least 17. Some variations may require the dealer to hit on a soft 17 
                (a hand containing an Ace valued as 11).
                <br><br>
                <b>4º</b>
                <br>
                <u>Winning:</u>
                <br><br>
                If your hand is closer to 21 than the dealer's without busting, you win.
                A Blackjack (an Ace and a 10-value card) typically pays 3:2.
                If you and the dealer tie, it's a "push," and you get your bet back.
                <br><br>
                <b>5º</b>
                <br>
                <u>Insurance:</u>
                <br><br>
                If the dealer's upcard is an Ace, players have the option to buy "insurance" against a potential dealer Blackjack. 
                Insurance is a separate bet and pays 2:1 if the dealer has a Blackjack.
                <br><br>
                <b>6º</b>
                <br>
                <u>Enjoy:</u>
                <br><br>
                Remember, the key is to make strategic decisions based on your hand and the dealer's upcard. 
                Enjoy the game, and good luck at the Blackjack table!
